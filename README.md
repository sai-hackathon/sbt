What Sai Entertainment  solves: Since the existing work history forms are self-applied, the evaluation tends to be more influenced by job search/career readiness than by intrinsic competence. This has become a factor in post-employment mismatches. In addition, existing evaluation systems often result in inappropriate information as data for third parties to refer to, as subjectivity and discovery affect the results of evaluations. Furthermore, in existing talent management systems, individual evaluation information is stored within the company and individuals do not take it out.

Product description: In our product, we have utilized the characteristics of the blockchain to create a state in which activity history and evaluation information cannot be tampered with, and by linking this information to the SBT, it is possible to attribute evaluation information to individuals, so that we could provide more transparency in the Job market.
